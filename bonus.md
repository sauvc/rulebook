## Bonus Round: Oceanic Navigation

For SAUVC 2024, there is a bonus round with a single task called Oceanic Navigation. This was created to allow teams to experience the challenges of operating in an oceanic environment. The bonus round will be held in the [TCOMS Ocean Basin](https://www.tcoms.sg/), a cutting-edge facility for testing and developing marine technology. The basin is located at the [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/).

The aim of this task is for the AUV to swim through a gate in the middle of the pool. At the ocean basin, the AUVs will have to deal with waves and currents. Only the top teams from the final round will be invited to the bonus round.

**An orange flare** may be located anywhere in the ocean basin. The AUV **has to avoid** touching the orange flare. Any part of the AUV touching the orange flare causes an immediate <span class="important">abort</span> of the attempt.

#### Arena (Ocean Basin)

The basin is equipped with a wave generator capable of generating waves up to 0.5m in height and a current generator capable of generating currents up to 1.5m/s. The wave and current generators may be activated during the bonus round.

_This layout is for illustration purposes only; Deployment and retrieval location may be subject to changes._

Since the basin is a research facility, and the area is not typically open to the public, only a small predetermined number of the participants and viewers will be allowed into the facility to watch the attempt from the viewing gallery.

Members of the team doing the attempt will have to operate at the AUV Deployment/Retrieval corner under the supervision of SAUVC committee members.

Judges and TCOMS staff will be located in the subcarriage in the facility which will be positioned above the gate, providing a direct view of the gate. After a successful round/abort, the AUV will be retrieved by divers.

Details on the number of participants allowed to enter the viewing gallery will be released at a later date.

#### Starting Zone

The starting zone is a **140Ã—140cm area** marked on the surface of the water. The teams **must** start their AUVs from this area. The team may only place the AUV at the water surface, it must autonomously submerge **before** leaving the starting zone.

#### Surfacing

Breaching the surface at any point during the mission causes <span class="emphasis">end of the current attempt</span>. The team may wish to retry if they still have time left.

#### Points

There will be no points awarded for the bonus round. The teams will be ranked based on the time taken to the <span class="emphasis">end of the attempt</span> ONLY IF the team successfully managed to complete the task. The team with the fastest time will be ranked first in the bonus round.

#### Specification of props

The gate is located in the middle of the basin, ~25m from the starting zone. The gate is 200cm tall and 200cm wide. The gate is marked with <span class="indicate-red">red</span> and <span class="indicate-green">green</span> stripes on the port and starboard sides respectively.

#### Gameplay (Bonus round)

Only the top teams from the final round will be allowed to attempt the bonus round. Ranking for the bonus round will be tabulated separately from the main competition. The top teams in the bonus round will receive a special bonus prize regardless of their performance in the main competition.

There will be NO practice time for the bonus round. The teams will be given 30 minutes to attempt the bonus round. The teams may attempt the bonus round as many times as they wish within the 30-minute time slot. The team may choose to abort the attempt at any time. However, the retrieval of the AUV might take some time because of the logistics involved.

- All the [safety](#safety) conditions and [game procedures](#game-procedure) including [aborting](#aborting) still apply during the bonus round.
- **No communication** with the AUV is allowed during the bonus round.
- The teams are **not allowed to deploy any other equipment** into the basin.
- Due to the sensitive nature of the equipment in the basin, the AUVs **must not touch the walls or the floor of the basin**. Any part of the AUV touching the walls of the basin causes an immediate <span class="important">abort</span> of the attempt.
