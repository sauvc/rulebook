## Video Submission

All teams are to submit a video of their AUV prior to the competition. The video has to

-  be maximum **5 minutes** long,
-  be submitted at least **1 week** prior to the competition,
-  showcase the AUV swimming underwater for at least **10 seconds**.

Videos will be reviewed by the organizing committee and accepted videos will count towards the Certificate of Participation.

## Qualification

- AUVs have to pass a qualifying round before they can participate in the main arena.
- To qualify, an AUV has to swim between two markers separated by **10 meters** and without surfacing or touching the bottom/wall.
- The time taken to pass the qualifier round decides the sequence in which the teams will participate in the final round of the competition. The team that finished the last in the qualifying round would participate first in the final round.

## Tasks
There are 4 tasks in the challenge:

1. [Navigation](#1.-navigation)
1. [Target Acquisition](#2.-target-acquisition)
1. [Localization](#3.-target-reacquisition)
1. [Target Reacquisition](#4.-localization)

The first task, Navigation, is mandatory and **must be completed** before attempting any other task. The other tasks can be attempted in any order. Surfacing at any point signifies <span style="text-decoration:underline; color: #35b720;"><em>end of attempt</em></span>.

### 1. Navigation
The aim of the this task is to swim through a gate in water. The gate is approximately 800 cm away from the starting point. The AUV has to swim through the 150 cm high gate.

<div style="text-align:center"> Figure 8. Front-view of the gate. </div>

### 2. Target Acquisition
The aim of the task is to detect and acquire a target among a series of drums at the bottom of the pool, in the target zone.

A target zone is defined by a <span style="color:green">green colored mat</span> laid out on the floor of the pool. The mat is 8m x 2m in size. Figure 3. shows the location of the mat with respect to the arena.

There are 4 colored drums in the arena. All of them are on the mat. One of the drums, chosen at random, will be <span style="color:blue">blue</span> in color. One of the <span style="color:red">red drums</span>, chosen at random, will contain an acoustic pinger. The AUV needs to drop a ball in one of the drums to successfully complete this task. In the event of multiple balls being dropped, only the **first ball** is taken to consideration.

The location of the <span style="color:red">red drum</span> which contains the acoustic pinger may be randomized between attempts, as may be the order of the drums.

#### Points.

Points will be awarded as follows.

- Drop the ball in the <span style="color:blue">blue drum</span>: <span style="text-decoration:underline; color: #21a796;"><strong>30 Points</strong></span>
- Drop the ball in the <span style="color:red">red drum</span> with the pinger: <span style="text-decoration:underline; color: #21a796;"><strong>50 Points</strong></span>
- Dropping the ball in any other <span style="color:red">red drum</span>: <span style="text-decoration:underline; color: #21a796;"><strong>10 Points</strong></span>

### 3. Target Reacquisition
The aim of this task is to reacquire a previously detected target.

This task is only attemptable if the [Target Acquisition](#2.-target-acquisition) has been successfully completed. Furthermore, the AUV has to leave the target zone, before it can attempt the Target Reacquisition task. Every part of the AUV needs to clear the target zone, before it can be considered outside the target zone.

After the AUV is outside the target zone, it needs to reacquire the target and pick up the ball that it dropped in the [Target Acquisition](#2.-target-acquisition) task. The AUV has to hold on to the ball till the <span style="text-decoration:underline; color: #35b720;"><em>end of attempt</em></span> to successfully complete this task.

This task does not have to be attempted immediately after Target Acquisition task, other tasks may be attempted in between.

#### Points.

If the AUV successfully picks up the ball and holds on to it till the <span style="text-decoration:underline; color: #35b720;"><em>end of the attempt</em></span>, <span style="text-decoration:underline; color: #21a796;"><strong>60 Points</strong></span> will be awarded.

#### Specification of props.

|   |       Prop       |              Description                |
|---|:----------------:|:---------------------------------------:|
| 1 | Target zone      | <span style="color:green">Green</span> mat 8m x 2m in size.|
| 2 | Ball             | Same ball used in target acquisition task. Provided by the teams.|

### 4. Localization
The aim of the this task is to localize on a flare. The flare is marked with an acoustic pinger. This flare could be located **anywhere** within the main arena. The AUV should locate and bump the flare causing the golf ball on the flare to drop out. The flare will be <span style="color:#E0D000">yellow</span> in color.

#### Points.

If the AUV successfully causes the ball to drop from the flare, <span style="text-decoration:underline; color: #21a796;"><strong>40 Points</strong></span> will be awarded.

#### Specification of props.

|   |       Prop       |              Description                |

### Surfacing
Breaching the surface any point during the mission causes <span style="text-decoration:underline; color: #35b720;"><em>end of the current attempt</em></span>. The team may wish to retry if they still have time left.

When the AUV surfaces, and the current attempt comes to an end, the total points for that attempt will be computed based on the tasks accomplished and the timing bonus and a <span style="text-decoration:underline; color: #21a796;"><strong>5 Points</strong></span> bonus for ending.

### Aborting
At any time during the mission, current attempt can be <span style="text-decoration:underline; color: #bd1717;"><em>aborted</em></span>, by indicating to the Game Master. The divers would then retreive the AUV back to the starting zone. The timing for the current attempt is stopped at the time of indication. The team may wish to retry if they still have time left.

In the case of an aborted attempt, the team would be awarded the points for all previously successfully completed tasks during the current attempt.

### Automatic Abort
If the AUV touches the bottom or the side walls of the pool for cumulative time of more than 10 seconds, the current attempt would be automatically <span style="text-decoration:underline; color: #bd1717;"><em>aborted</em></span>. The divers would then retreive the AUV back to the starting zone. The team may wish to retry if they still have time left.

In the case of an automatic aborted attempt, the team would be awarded the points for all previously successfully completed tasks during the attempt.

### Timing Bonus

At the <span style="text-decoration:underline; color: #35b720;"><em>end of an attempt</em></span>, as long as the AUV has successfully completed **2 tasks**, the Navigation task and any other task, bonus points proportional to the remaining time will be awarded in accordance with the following formula.

`Bonus points = (900 - RUN_TIME) â€¢ 0.03`

For eg. For a run time of 420s, Bonus = (900-420)â€¢0.03 = 14.4 Points

### Penalties

There are penalty points for touching the floor or wall of the pool at any time, and also for touching the gate. This penalty points are:

|   |               Description               | Penalty Points |
|---|:---------------------------------------:|:--------------:|
| 1 | Touching the gate                       |        2       |
| 2 | Touching the bottom of the pool or wall |        5       |
