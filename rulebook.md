## Structure of the Team

A team may consist of up to **11 participants** including **faculty supervisors**. At least half of the participants must be non-professionals (students, hobbyists, hackerspace members, etc) at the time of registration.

![arena](img/team.jpg)
<p class="image-caption"> Figure 1. One of the teams with faculty co-supervisors from the 2017 Competition.</p>

## Video Submission

All teams have to submit a video of their AUV prior to the competition. The video has to

-  be maximum **5 minutes** long,
-  be submitted before February 8, 2019,
-  showcase the AUV swimming underwater for at least **10 seconds**.
-  showcase the **operation and safety** of the [Kill Switch](#safety).

Videos will be reviewed by the organizing committee and **only teams with accepted videos be allowed to attend the competition**.

The organizers reserve the right to publish the video submissions after the competition.

## Qualification

- AUVs have to pass a qualifying round before they can participate in the main arena.
- To qualify, an AUV has to swim from **qualification starting line** and pass through the **qualification gate** without surfacing, touching the bottom/wall or the qualification gate.
- The time taken for the **last part** of the AUV to pass through the **qualification gate** will be counted towards the qualification time.
- Teams will be allocated a time slot for the qualification round. Teams may attempt multiple qualifying runs during the qualifying slot.
- If multiple qualifying runs are attempted during the qualifying slot, the fastest successful run will be considered for the final round.
- **Only the top 15** qualified teams, with the fastest time for the qualifying round, will advance to the final round.
- The time taken to pass the qualifier round decides the sequence in which the teams will participate in the final round of the competition. The team that finished the last in the qualifying round would participate first in the final round.

<p class="image-caption"> Figure 5. Picture of the Arena from 2017 Competition.</p>

### Qualification Arena(s)
The qualification rounds would be held on the side of the main arena.

The qualification starting line is a marked 1m wide section of the pool wall from where the AUV should be deployed from. The AUV **has to touch the wall** at the begining of the run.

At approximately 10m from the starting line the qualification gate is hanging from the surface of the water. The AUV has to go through the gate to qualify.

#### Specification of props

|   |       Prop           |              Description                |

<p class="image-caption"> Figure 6. Front-view of the qualification gate.</p>

### Starting Zone
The starting zone is a **140Ã—140cm area** marked on the surface of water. The teams  **must** start their AUVs from this area. The team may only place the AUV at the water surface, it must autonomously submerge **before** leaving the starting zone.

![arena](img/starting-zone-2017.jpg)
<p class="image-caption"> Figure 7. Picture of the Starting Zone from 2017 Competition.</p>

## Tasks
There are 4 tasks in the challenge:

1. [Navigation](#1.-navigation)
1. [Target Acquisition](#2.-target-acquisition)
1. [Target Reacquisition](#3.-target-reacquisition)
1. [Localization](#4.-localization)

The first task, Navigation, is mandatory and **must be completed** before attempting any other task. The other tasks can be attempted in any order. Surfacing at any point signifies <span class="emphasis">end of attempt</span>.

### 1. Navigation
The aim of the this task is to swim through a gate in water. The gate may be located anywhere on a horizontal line, parallel to the side of the swimming pool, approximately 8m away from the starting point. See Figure 4. The AUV has to swim through the 150 cm high gate without touching the gate.

![flare](img/gate-2016.jpg)
<p class="image-caption"> Figure 8. Picture of the gate from 2016 Competition.</p>

#### Points

If the AUV successfully passes through the gate,<span class="info">10 Points</span> will be awarded.

![flare](img/gate.jpg)
<p class="image-caption"> Figure 9. Front-view of the gate.</p>

### 2. Target Acquisition
The aim of the task is to detect and acquire a target among a series of drums at the bottom of the pool, in the target zone.

A target zone is defined by a <span class="indicate-green">green colored mat</span> laid out on the floor of the pool. The mat is 8m x 2m in size. Figure 4. shows the location of the mat with respect to the arena.

There are 4 colored drums in the arena. All of them are on the mat. One of the drums, chosen at random, will be <span class="indicate-blue">blue</span> in color, while the rest are <span class="indicate-red">red</span> in color. One of the <span class="indicate-red">red drums</span>, chosen at random, will contain an acoustic pinger. The AUV needs to drop a ball in one of the drums to successfully complete this task. Points will be awarded based on which drum the ball is dropped into. In the event of multiple balls being dropped, only the **first ball** is taken to consideration.

The location of the <span class="indicate-red">red drum</span> which contains the acoustic pinger may be randomized between attempts, as may be the order of the drums. The order of the drums and location of the pinger will be decided by the organizing committee.

#### Points

Points will be awarded as follows.

- Drop the ball in the <span class="indicate-blue">blue drum</span>: <span class="info">30 Points</span>
- Drop the ball in the <span class="indicate-red">red drum</span> with the pinger: <span class="info">50 Points</span>
- Dropping the ball in any other <span class="indicate-red">red drum</span>: <span class="info">10 Points</span>

### 3. Target Reacquisition
The aim of this task is to reacquire a previously detected target.

This task is only attemptable if the [Target Acquisition](#2.-target-acquisition) has been successfully completed. Furthermore, the AUV has to leave the target zone, before it can attempt the Target Reacquisition task. Every part of the AUV needs to clear the target zone, before it can be considered outside the target zone.

After the AUV is outside the target zone, it needs to reacquire the target and pick up the ball that it dropped in the [Target Acquisition](#2.-target-acquisition) task. The AUV has to hold on to the ball till the <span class="emphasis">end of attempt</span> to successfully complete this task.

This task does not have to be attempted immediately after Target Acquisition task, other tasks may be attempted in between.

#### Points

If the AUV successfully picks up the ball and holds on to it till the <span class="emphasis">end of the attempt</span>, <span class="info">60 Points</span> will be awarded.

#### Specification of props

|   |       Prop       |              Description                |

| 2 | Ball             | Same ball used in target acquisition task. Provided by the teams.|

### 4. Localization
The aim of this task is to localize on a flare. The flare is marked with an acoustic pinger. This flare could be located **anywhere** within the main arena. The AUV should locate and bump the flare causing the golf ball on the flare to drop out. The flare will be <span class="indicate-yellow">yellow</span> in color.

#### Points

If the AUV successfully causes the ball to drop from the flare, <span class="info">40 Points</span> will be awarded.

#### Specification of props

<p class="image-caption"> Figure 14. Picture of the flare from 2016 Competition.</p>

### Surfacing

Breaching the surface any point during the mission causes <span class="emphasis">end of the current attempt</span>, the total points for that attempt will be computed based on the tasks accomplished in that attempt and the timing bonus (if applicable) and a <span class="info">5 Points</span> bonus for ending. The team may wish to retry if they still have time left.

### Aborting
At any time during the mission, current attempt can be <span class="important">aborted</span>, by indicating to the <span class="inverse">Game Master</span>. The divers would then retrieve the AUV back to the starting zone. The timing for the current attempt is stopped at the time of indication. The team may wish to retry if they still have time left.

In the case of an aborted attempt, the team would be awarded the points for all previously successfully completed tasks during the current attempt.

### Automatic Abort
If the AUV touches the bottom or the side walls of the pool for **a cumulative time of more than 10 seconds or 5 discrete touches**, the current attempt would be automatically <span class="important">aborted</span>. The divers would then retrieve the AUV back to the starting zone. The team may wish to retry if they still have time left.

In the case of an automatic aborted attempt, the team would be awarded the points for all previously successfully completed tasks during the attempt.

### Timing Bonus

At the <span class="emphasis">end of an attempt</span>, as long as the AUV has successfully completed at least **2 tasks**, the Navigation task and any other task, bonus points proportional to the remaining time will be awarded in accordance with the following formula.

`Bonus points = (900 - RUN_TIME) â€¢ 0.03`

For eg. For a run time of 420s, Bonus = (900-420)â€¢0.03 = 14.4 Points

### Penalties

There are penalty points for touching the floor or wall of the pool at any time, and also for touching the gate during a specific attempt. This penalty points are:

|   |               Description               | Penalty Points |
|---|:---------------------------------------:|:--------------:|
| 1 | Touching the gate                       |        2       |
| 2 | Touching the bottom of the pool or wall |        5       |
