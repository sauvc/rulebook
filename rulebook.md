## Structure of the Team

A team may consist of up to **8 participants** and up to **3 faculty co-supervisors**. At least half of the participants must be students at the time of registration.

![arena](img/team.jpg)
<div class="caption"> Figure 1. One of the teams with faculty co-supervisors from the 2017 Competition.</div>

## Video Submission

All teams have to submit a video of their AUV prior to the competition. The video has to

-  be maximum **5 minutes** long,
-  be submitted before February 8, 2018,
-  showcase the AUV swimming underwater for at least **10 seconds**.

Videos will be reviewed by the organizing committee and **only teams with accepted videos be allowed to attend the competition**.

The origanisers reserve the right to publish the video submissions after the competition.

## Qualification

- AUVs have to pass a qualifying round before they can participate in the main arena.
- To qualify, an AUV has to swim between two markers separated by **10 meters** and without surfacing or touching the bottom/wall.
- From the list of all qualified teams, **only 15** teams, with the fastest time for the qualification round, will advance to the final round.
- The time taken to pass the qualifier round decides the sequence in which the teams will participate in the final round of the competition. The team that finished the last in the qualifying round would participate first in the final round.

<div class="caption"> Figure 5. Picture of the Arena from 2017 Competition.</div>

### Starting Zone
The starting zone is a **140Ã—140cm area** marked on the surface of water. The teams  **must** start their AUVs from this area. The team may only place the AUV at the water surface, it must autonomously submerge **before** leaving the starting zone.

![arena](img/starting-zone-2017.jpg)
<div class="caption"> Figure 6. Picture of the Starting Zone from 2017 Competition.</div>

## Tasks
There are 4 tasks in the challenge:

1. [Navigation](#1.-navigation)
1. [Target Acquisition](#2.-target-acquisition)
1. [Target Reacquisition](#3.-target-reacquisition)
1. [Localization](#4.-localization)

The first task, Navigation, is mandatory and **must be completed** before attempting any other task. The other tasks can be attempted in any order. Surfacing at any point signifies <span class="end"><em>end of attempt</em></span>.

### 1. Navigation
The aim of the this task is to swim through a gate in water. The gate may be located anywhere on a horizontal line, parallel to the side of the swimming pool, approximately 8m away from the starting point. See Figure 3. The AUV has to swim through the 150 cm high gate without touching the gate.

![flare](img/gate-2016.jpg)
<div class="caption"> Figure 7. Picture of the gate from 2016 Competition.</div>

#### Points.

If the AUV successfully passes through the gate,<span class="points"><strong>10 Points</strong></span> will be awarded.

#### Specification of props.

|   |       Prop       |              Description                |
|---|:----------------:|:---------------------------------------:|
| 1 | Gate             | 150cm wide and 150cm high gate with <span style="color:red">red</span> and <span style="color:green">green</span> markings on port and starboard sides respectively.

![flare](img/gate.jpg)
<div class="caption"> Figure 8. Front-view of the gate. </div>

### 2. Target Acquisition
The aim of the task is to detect and acquire a target among a series of drums at the bottom of the pool, in the target zone.

A target zone is defined by a <span style="color:green">green colored mat</span> laid out on the floor of the pool. The mat is 8m x 2m in size. Figure 3. shows the location of the mat with respect to the arena.

There are 4 colored drums in the arena. All of them are on the mat. One of the drums, chosen at random, will be <span style="color:blue">blue</span> in color, while the rest are <span style="color:red">red</span> in color. One of the <span style="color:red">red drums</span>, chosen at random, will contain an acoustic pinger. The AUV needs to drop a ball in one of the drums to successfully complete this task. Points will be awarded based on which drum the ball is dropped into. In the event of multiple balls being dropped, only the **first ball** is taken to consideration.

The location of the <span style="color:red">red drum</span> which contains the acoustic pinger may be randomized between attempts, as may be the order of the drums. The order or the drums and location of the pinger will be decided by the organizing committee.

#### Points.

Points will be awarded as follows.

- Drop the ball in the <span style="color:blue">blue drum</span>: <span class="points"><strong>30 Points</strong></span>
- Drop the ball in the <span style="color:red">red drum</span> with the pinger: <span class="points"><strong>50 Points</strong></span>
- Dropping the ball in any other <span style="color:red">red drum</span>: <span class="points"><strong>10 Points</strong></span>

#### Specification of props.

|   |       Prop       |              Description                |
|---|:----------------:|:---------------------------------------:|
| 1 | Drum             | 60cm in diameter and 30cm in depth.     |
| 2 | Ball             | 3.5-4.5cm in diameter and weigh no more than 200g in air. Provided by teams. |
| 3 | Drum Pinger    | [RJE International Pinger Model No. ULB-362B/45 kHz](http://www.rjeint.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ULB-362-ULB-362PL-Manual.pdf).|

### 3. Target Reacquisition
The aim of this task is to reacquire a previously detected target.

This task is only attemptable if the [Target Acquisition](#2.-target-acquisition) has been successfully completed. Furthermore, the AUV has to leave the target zone, before it can attempt the Target Reacquisition task. Every part of the AUV needs to clear the target zone, before it can be considered outside the target zone.

After the AUV is outside the target zone, it needs to reacquire the target and pick up the ball that it dropped in the [Target Acquisition](#2.-target-acquisition) task. The AUV has to hold on to the ball till the <span class="end"><em>end of attempt</em></span> to successfully complete this task.

This task does not have to be attempted immediately after Target Acquisition task, other tasks may be attempted in between.

#### Points.

If the AUV successfully picks up the ball and holds on to it till the <span class="end"><em>end of the attempt</em></span>, <span class="points"><strong>60 Points</strong></span> will be awarded.

#### Specification of props.

|   |       Prop       |              Description                |
|---|:----------------:|:---------------------------------------:|
| 1 | Target zone      | <span style="color:green">Green</span> mat 8m x 2m in size.|
| 2 | Ball             | Same ball used in target acquisition task. Provided by the teams.|

### 4. Localization
The aim of this task is to localize on a flare. The flare is marked with an acoustic pinger. This flare could be located **anywhere** within the main arena. The AUV should locate and bump the flare causing the golf ball on the flare to drop out. The flare will be <span style="color:#E0D000">yellow</span> in color.

#### Points.

If the AUV successfully causes the ball to drop from the flare, <span class="points"><strong>40 Points</strong></span> will be awarded.

#### Specification of props.

|   |       Prop       |              Description                |
|---|:----------------:|:---------------------------------------:|
| 1 | Flare            | 150cm high and <span style="color:#E0D000">yellow</span> in color.|
| 2 | Flare Pinger     | [RJE International Pinger Model No. ULB-362B/37.5 kHz](http://www.rjeint.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ULB-362-ULB-362PL-Manual.pdf).|

### Surfacing

Breaching the surface any point during the mission causes <span class="end"><em>end of the current attempt</em></span>, the total points for that attempt will be computed based on the tasks accomplished in that attempt and the timing bonus (if applicable) and a <span class="points"><strong>5 Points</strong></span> bonus for ending. The team may wish to retry if they still have time left.

### Aborting
At any time during the mission, current attempt can be <span class="abort"><em>aborted</em></span>, by indicating to the <span class="role">Game Master</span>. The divers would then retreive the AUV back to the starting zone. The timing for the current attempt is stopped at the time of indication. The team may wish to retry if they still have time left.

In the case of an aborted attempt, the team would be awarded the points for all previously successfully completed tasks during the current attempt.

### Automatic Abort
If the AUV touches the bottom or the side walls of the pool for **a cumulative time of more than 10 seconds or 5 discrete touches**, the current attempt would be automatically <span class="abort"><em>aborted</em></span>. The divers would then retreive the AUV back to the starting zone. The team may wish to retry if they still have time left.

In the case of an automatic aborted attempt, the team would be awarded the points for all previously successfully completed tasks during the attempt.

### Timing Bonus

At the <span class="end"><em>end of an attempt</em></span>, as long as the AUV has successfully completed at least **2 tasks**, the Navigation task and any other task, bonus points proportional to the remaining time will be awarded in accordance with the following formula.

`Bonus points = (900 - RUN_TIME) â€¢ 0.03`

For eg. For a run time of 420s, Bonus = (900-420)â€¢0.03 = 14.4 Points

### Penalties

There are penalty points for touching the floor or wall of the pool at any time, and also for touching the gate during a specific attempt. This penalty points are:

|   |               Description               | Penalty Points |
|---|:---------------------------------------:|:--------------:|
| 1 | Touching the gate                       |        2       |
| 2 | Touching the bottom of the pool or wall |        5       |
