## Video Submission

All teams have to submit a video of their AUV prior to the competition. The video **HAS TO**

-  be maximum **30 seconds** long,
-  be submitted before 23:59 January 7th, 2024, [Anywhere On Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anywhere_on_Earth),
-  showcase the tether-less operation of AUV swimming underwater for at least **10 seconds**.
-  show clearly that someone pressing the [Kill Switch](#safety) should stop all thrusters immediately.

Videos will be reviewed by the organizing committee and **30 teams with the best vehicles will be short-listed to attend the competition**.

The organizers reserve the right to publish the video submissions after the competition.

## Qualification

- AUVs have to pass a qualifying round before they can participate in the main arena.
- To qualify, an AUV has to swim from **qualification starting line** and pass through the **qualification gate** without surfacing, touching the bottom/wall or the qualification gate.
- The time taken for the **last part** of the AUV to pass through the **qualification gate** will be counted towards the qualification time.
- Teams will be allocated a time slot for the qualification round. Teams may attempt multiple qualifying runs during the qualifying slot.
- If multiple qualifying runs are attempted during the qualifying slot, the fastest successful run will be considered for the final round.
- **Only the top 15** qualified teams, with the fastest time for the qualifying round, will advance to the final round.
- The time taken to pass the qualifier round decides the sequence in which the teams will participate in the final round of the competition. The team that finished the last in the qualifying round would participate first in the final round.

### Qualification Arena(s)
The qualification rounds would be held on the side of the main arena.

The qualification starting line is a marked 1m wide section of the pool wall from where the AUV should be deployed from. The AUV **has to touch the wall** at the begining of the run.

At approximately 10m from the starting line the qualification gate is hanging from the surface of the water. The AUV has to go through the gate to qualify. If the AUV touches **ANY** of the 3 sides of the qualification gate, the attempt is considered a failure.

#### Specification of props

<p class="image-caption">Front-view of the qualification gate.</p>

### Starting Zone

The starting zone is a **140Ã—140cm area** marked on the surface of water. The teams  **must** start their AUVs from this area. The team may only place the AUV at the water surface, it must autonomously submerge **before** leaving the starting zone. Teams may also place their [communication equipment](#specification-of-auv) in the starting zone.

## Tasks

There are 4 tasks in the challenge:

1. [Navigation](#1.-navigation)
1. [Target Acquisition](#2.-target-acquisition)
1. [Target Reacquisition](#3.-target-reacquisition)
1. [Communication & Localization](#4.-localization)

The first task, Navigation, is mandatory and **must be completed** before attempting any other task. The other tasks can be attempted in any order. Surfacing at any point signifies <span class="emphasis">end of the attempt</span>.

### 1. Navigation

The aim of this task is to swim through a gate placed at the bottom of the pool. The gate may be located anywhere on a horizontal line, parallel to the side of the swimming pool, approximately 12m away from the starting zone. See Figure 4. The AUV has to swim through the 150 cm tall gate without touching the gate.

**A orange flare** may be located anywhere in a rectangular zone 4m-8m from side of the arena, before the gate. The AUV **has to avoid** touching the orange flare. Any part of the AUV touching the orange flare causes an immediate <span class="important">abort</span> of the attempt.

### 2. Target Acquisition

The aim of the task is to detect and acquire a target among a series of drums at the bottom of the pool, in the target zone.

A target zone is defined by a <span class="indicate-green">green colored mat</span> laid out on the floor of the pool. The mat is 8m x 2m in size. Figure 4. shows the location of the mat with respect to the arena.

There are 4 colored drums in the arena. All of them are on the mat. One of the drums, chosen at random, will be <span class="indicate-blue">blue</span> in color, while the rest are <span class="indicate-red">red</span> in color. One of the <span class="indicate-red">red drums</span>, chosen at random, will contain an acoustic pinger. The AUV needs to drop a ball in one of the drums to successfully complete this task. Points will be awarded based on which drum the ball is dropped into. In the event of multiple balls being dropped, only the **first ball** is taken to consideration.

The location of the <span class="indicate-red">red drum</span> which contains the acoustic pinger may be randomized between attempts, as may be the order of the drums. The order of the drums and location of the pinger will be decided by the organizing committee.

#### Points

Points will be awarded as follows.

- Drop the ball in the <span class="indicate-blue">blue drum</span>: <span class="info">30 Points</span>
- Drop the ball in the <span class="indicate-red">red drum</span> with the pinger: <span class="info">50 Points</span>
- Dropping the ball in any other <span class="indicate-red">red drum</span>: <span class="info">10 Points</span>

#### Specification of props

### 3. Target Reacquisition

The aim of this task is to reacquire a previously detected target.

This task is only attempt-able if the [Target Acquisition](#2.-target-acquisition) has been successfully completed. Furthermore, the AUV has to leave the target zone, before it can attempt the Target Reacquisition task. Every part of the AUV needs to clear the target zone, before it can be considered outside the target zone.

After the AUV is outside the target zone, it needs to reacquire the target and pick up the ball that it dropped in the [Target Acquisition](#2.-target-acquisition) task. The AUV has to hold on to the ball till the <span class="emphasis">end of attempt</span> to successfully complete this task.

This task does not have to be attempted immediately after Target Acquisition task, other tasks may be attempted in between.

#### Points

If the AUV successfully picks up the ball and holds on to it till the <span class="emphasis">end of the attempt</span>, <span class="info">60 Points</span> will be awarded.

#### Specification of props

|   |       Prop       |              Description                |
|---|:----------------:|:---------------------------------------:|
| 1 | Target zone      | <span class="indicate-green">Green</span> mat 8m x 2m in size.|
| 2 | Ball             | Same ball used in target acquisition task. Provided by the teams.|

### 4. Communication & Localization

The aim of this task is to localize on coloured flares and bump them causing a golf ball to drop out. There are **3 coloured flares** in the arena, one **red coloured flare**, one **yellow coloured flare** and one **blue coloured flare**. These flares could be located **anywhere** within the main arena. The AUV may locate and bump a flares in **a specified order**, which may be communicated to the AUV, to receive bonus points.

On every attempt, after the AUV successfully completes the _Navigation task_, the team will be informed of the **order** in which the flares have to be bumped. The **specified order** may be different between different attempts. The order will specified using the following notation, joined by a hyphen (-).

- <span class="indicate-red">Red</span> : **R**
- <span class="indicate-yellow">Yellow</span> : **Y**
- <span class="indicate-blue">Blue</span> : **B**

So, for example, specifying the order as **R-B-Y** would mean that the AUV has to bump the **red flare** first, followed by the **blue flare** and finally the **yellow flare**.

The team is then allowed to communicate the **order** with their AUVs using their [communication equipment](#specification-of-auv).

#### Points

Points would be awarded as follows.

- Successfully causes the ball to drop from any flare via contact or proximity : <span class="info">20 Points per flare</span>
- Successfully causes the ball to drop all 3 flares in the **specified order** : <span class="info">60 Points</span> (in addition to above)

#### Specification of props

|   |       Prop       |              Description                |
|---|:----------------:|:---------------------------------------:|
| 1 | Red Flare        | 80cm tall, ~1.6cm in diameter, and <span class="indicate-red">red</span> in color.|
| 1 | Yellow Flare     | 80cm tall, ~1.6cm in diameter, and <span class="indicate-yellow">yellow</span> in color.|
| 1 | Blue Flare       | 80cm tall, ~1.6cm in diameter, and <span class="indicate-blue">blue</span> in color.|

![flare](img/flares-2024.jpg)
<p class="image-caption">Side-view of the flares. </p>

### Surfacing

Breaching the surface any point during the mission causes <span class="emphasis">end of the current attempt</span>, the total points for that attempt will be computed based on the tasks accomplished in that attempt and the timing bonus (if applicable) and a <span class="info">5 Points</span> bonus for ending. The team may wish to retry if they still have time left.

### Aborting

At any time during the mission, current attempt can be <span class="important">aborted</span>, by indicating to the <span class="inverse">Game Master</span>. The divers would then retrieve the AUV back to the starting zone. The timing for the current attempt is stopped at the time of indication. The team may wish to retry if they still have time left.

In the case of an aborted attempt, the team would be awarded the points for all previously successfully completed tasks during the current attempt.

### Automatic Abort

If the AUV touches the bottom or the side walls of the pool for **a cumulative time of more than 10 seconds or 5 discrete touches**, the current attempt would be automatically <span class="important">aborted</span>. The divers would then retrieve the AUV back to the starting zone. The team may wish to retry if they still have time left.

In the case of an automatic aborted attempt, the team would be awarded the points for all previously successfully completed tasks during the attempt.

### Timing Bonus

At the <span class="emphasis">end of an attempt</span>, as long as the AUV has successfully completed at least **2 tasks**, the Navigation task and any other task, bonus points proportional to the remaining time will be awarded in accordance with the following formula.

`Bonus points = (900 - RUN_TIME) â€¢ 0.03`

For eg. For a run time of 420s, Bonus = (900-420)â€¢0.03 = 14.4 Points

### Penalties

There are penalty points for touching the floor or wall of the pool at any time, and also for touching the gate during a specific attempt. This penalty points are:

|   |               Description               | Penalty Points |
|---|:---------------------------------------:|:--------------:|
| 1 | Touching the gate                       |        2       |
| 2 | Touching the bottom of the pool or wall |        5       |

- AUVs will be tested for battery, oil or lubricant leak check, and a waterproofness check. Failing either would bar the team from attempting to qualify until the AUV passes the checks.f
- Team will proceed to qualifying round. The bonus points for size and weight is applicable only if the team passes the qualifying round.
- Top 15 qualified teams (according to fastest qualifying round times) will proceed to the final rounds of competition.
- The final round will be held in the main arena.
- The top five teams from the final round will be allowed to attempt the [bonus round](#bonus-round-oceanic-navigation).

### Practice Rounds

- Teams will be allowed to practice in the main arena after they successfully complete the qualifying round, subject to availability of time slots and the schedule during the competition.
- No tethers are allowed at ANY time inside the main arena.
- Teams will be allowed calibrate their AUV sensors with tethers, at the edge of the pool, with the vehicle held **stationary**.
