    <article class="markdown-body"><h2 id="objective"><a class="header-link" href="#objective"></a>Objective</h2>
<p>The goal is for each team to design and build an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle which can negotiate the tasks put forth under a prescribed time. Also to learn and have fun in the process.</p>
<h2 id="structure-of-the-team"><a class="header-link" href="#structure-of-the-team"></a>Structure of the Team</h2>
<p>A team may consist of up to eight participants and up to 3 faculty co-supervisors. At least half of the participants must be students at the time of registration.</p>
<h2 id="the-arena"><a class="header-link" href="#the-arena"></a>The Arena</h2>
<p>The challenge will be held in an olympic sized swimming pool. There are 3 tasks in the challenge:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Swimming through the gate</li>
<li>Dropping a ball in the correct drum</li>
<li>Bumping a flare</li>
</ul>
<p>The first task, swimming through the gate is mandatory and must be completed before attempting any other task. The other tasks can be attempted in any order. Surfacing at any point signifies end of mission.</p>
<p class="img-container"><img src="img/arena.jpg" alt="arena"></p>
<h3 id="starting-zone"><a class="header-link" href="#starting-zone"></a>Starting Zone</h3>
<p>The starting zone is a 140×140cm area marked on the surface of water. The teams must start their AUVs from this area. The team may only place the AUV at the water surface, it must autonomously submerge before leaving the starting zone.</p>
<h3 id="swimming-through-the-gate"><a class="header-link" href="#swimming-through-the-gate"></a>Swimming through the gate</h3>
<p>The gate is approximately 800 cm away from the starting point. The AUV has to swim through the 150 cm high gate. The gate will have red and green sides marking port and starboard sides respectively. [10 Points]</p>
<p class="img-container"><img src="img/gate.jpg" alt="flare"></p>
<p>The following tasks can be done in any order.</p>
<h3 id="dropping-the-ball"><a class="header-link" href="#dropping-the-ball"></a>Dropping the ball</h3>
<p>There are 4 coloured drums in the arena. All of them equidistant from the gate such that they lie on an arc. The AUV needs to drop a ball in the correct drum to successfully complete this task. Points are only awarded for a ball that remains in the bucket until the end of the game.</p>
<p>There are a few different modes of solving this challenge. The mode needs to be declared to the judges prior to each attempt. Failure to declare will result in the default mode (Optical)</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Optical [20 Points]<ul class="list">
<li>Drop the ball in the Yellow drum.</li>
<li>Dropping the ball in any other drum will be awarded [5 Points]</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Optical+Acoustic [30 Points]<ul class="list">
<li>A transducer will play a tone. Each frequency corresponds to a coloured drum. The Yellow drum is not used in this mode.<ul class="list">
<li>20kHz : Green</li>
<li>30kHz : Red</li>
<li>40kHz : Orange</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Dropping the ball in any other drum will be awarded [5 Points]</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Acoustic [50 Points]<ul class="list">
<li>A transducer in the target bucket will play a chirp from 20-30kHz. The Yellow drum is not used in this mode.</li>
<li>Dropping the ball in any other drum will be awarded [5 Points]</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the acoustic tasks (Optical+Acoustic/Acoustic), the target drum may change between attempts. The order of the drums may also change.</p>
<p>Drum: Approximately 50cm in diameter
Ball   : 3.5-4.5cm in diameter and weigh no more than 100g in air.
In the event of multiple balls being dropped, only the first ball is taken to consideration.</p>
<h3 id="flare"><a class="header-link" href="#flare"></a>Flare</h3>
<p>There is a flare marked with an acoustic pinger (37.5 kHz). This flare could be anywhere within the main arena. The AUV should locate and bump the flare causing the golf ball to drop out of the flare. [40 Points]</p>
<p>Flare Pinger: RJE International Pinger Model No. ULB-362/37.5 kHz</p>
<p class="img-container"><img src="img/flare.jpg" alt="flare"></p>
<h3 id="surfacing"><a class="header-link" href="#surfacing"></a>Surfacing</h3>
<p>Upon successful completion of all tasks, the AUV must surface (anywhere in the arena) to complete the mission. Bonus points proportional to the remaining time will be awarded in accordance with the following formula</p>
<p>Bonus points = (900 - min(RUN_TIME)) • 0.1</p>
<p>i.e. For a best run time of 420s, Bonus = (900-420)•0.1 = 48 Points</p>
<p>Successful completion of all tasks entails bumping the flare and dropping the ball (after swimming through the gate)</p>
<h3 id="penalties"><a class="header-link" href="#penalties"></a>Penalties</h3>
<p>Breaching the surface any point during the mission causes the current attempt to come to an end. The team may wish to try again if they still have time left.</p>
