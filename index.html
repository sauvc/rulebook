<h2 id="objectives"><a class="header-link" href="#objectives"></a>Objectives</h2>
<p>The goal is for each team to develop an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) which can negotiate the tasks put forth under a prescribed time and at the same time, to learn about underwater robotics and have fun in the process.</p>

<h2 id="video-submission"><a class="header-link" href="#video-submission"></a>Video Submission</h2>
<p>All teams have to submit a video of their AUV prior to the competition. The video <strong>HAS TO</strong></p>
<ul class="list">
<li> be <strong>maximum 30 seconds</strong> long,</li>
<li> be submitted before 23:59 4th January, 2025, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anywhere_on_Earth">Anywhere On Earth</a>,</li>
<li> showcase the tether-less operation of AUV swimming underwater for at least <strong>10 seconds</strong>.</li>
<li> show clearly that someone pressing the <a href="#safety">Kill Switch</a> should stop all thrusters immediately.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note: The video will not be played beyond 30 seconds, so whatever you want to showcase, must be done strictly within the 30 seconds.</strong></p>
<p>Donts: For your video, DO NOT</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>put the most important parts of the video after 30 seconds (safety, control etc.), as it will not be reviewed, without exception.</li>
<li>you do not need to showcase an intro of team structure, university details etc - this will only take up valuable time in your video.</li>
</ul>
<p>Videos will be reviewed by the organizing committee and <strong>35 teams with the best vehicles will be short-listed to attend the competition. The above criteria are the basic necessary criteria, failing which the teams wont be short-listed.</strong></p>
<p>The organizers reserve the right to publish the video submissions after the competition.</p>
<h2 id="updates-to-the-rulebook"><a class="header-link" href="#updates-to-the-rulebook"></a>Updates to the Rulebook</h2>

<p><strong>This is a preliminary version of the rulebook. The final version will be published in the next few months.</strong></p>
<h2 id="safety"><a class="header-link" href="#safety"></a>Safety</h2>
<ul class="list">
<li>AUVs must not leak and pollute the pool.</li>
<li>AUVs must be designed and manufactured as to pose no danger of any kind to anyone or anything at the venue. This includes making sure that thrusters/propeller blades are shrouded.</li>
