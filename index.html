    <article class="markdown-body"><h2 id="objective"><a class="header-link" href="#objective"></a>Objective</h2>
<p>The goal is for each team to design and build an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) which can negotiate the tasks put forth under a prescribed time. Also to learn and have fun in the process.</p>
<h2 id="structure-of-the-team"><a class="header-link" href="#structure-of-the-team"></a>Structure of the Team</h2>
<p>A team may consist of up to <strong>eight</strong> participants and up to 3 faculty co-supervisors. At least half of the participants must be students at the time of registration.</p>
<h2 id="video-submission"><a class="header-link" href="#video-submission"></a>Video Submission</h2>
<p>All teams are to submit a (maximum 5 minutes long) video of their AUV at least 1 week prior to the competition. The video should showcase the AUV swimming underwater for at least 10 seconds. Videos will be reviewed by the organizing committee and accepted videos will count towards the Certificate of Participation.</p>
<h2 id="qualification"><a class="header-link" href="#qualification"></a>Qualification</h2>
<ul class="list">
<li>AUVs have to pass a qualifying round before they can participate in the main arena.</li>
<li>To qualify an AUV has to swim between two underwater markers separated by 10 meters and without surfacing or touching the bottom/wall.</li>
<li>The time taken to pass the qualifier round decides the sequence in which the teams will participate in the final round of the competition. The team that finished the last in the qualifying round would participate first in the final round.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-arena"><a class="header-link" href="#the-arena"></a>The Arena</h2>
<p>The challenge will be held in an olympic sized swimming pool. There are 4 tasks in the challenge:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Visual Navigation</li>
<li>Target Acquisition</li>
<li>Localization</li>
<li>Target Reacquisition</li>
</ul>
<p>The first task, Visual Navigation is mandatory and must be completed before attempting any other task. The other tasks can be attempted in any order. Surfacing at any point signifies end of mission.</p>
<p class="img-container"><img src="img/arena.jpg" alt="arena"></p>
<div style="text-align:center"> Figure 1. Map of the Arena. </div>

<h3 id="starting-zone"><a class="header-link" href="#starting-zone"></a>Starting Zone</h3>
<p>The starting zone is a 140×140cm area marked on the surface of water. The teams <strong>must</strong> start their AUVs from this area. The team may only place the AUV at the water surface, it must autonomously submerge <strong>before</strong> leaving the starting zone.</p>
<h3 id="visual-navigation-10-points-"><a class="header-link" href="#visual-navigation-10-points-"></a>Visual Navigation [10 Points]</h3>
<p>The aim of the this task is to swim through a gate in water. The gate is approximately 800 cm away from the starting point. The AUV has to swim through the 150 cm high gate. The gate will have red and green sides marking port and starboard sides respectively.</p>

<h3 id="target-acquisition-10-50-points-"><a class="header-link" href="#target-acquisition-10-50-points-"></a>Target Acquisition [10-50 Points]</h3>
<p>The aim of the task is to detect and acquire a target among a series of drums at the bottom of the pool, in the target zone.</p>
<p>A target zone is defined by a green colored mat laid out on the floor of the pool. The mat is 8m x 2m in size. Figure 1. shows the location of the mat with respect to the arena.</p>
<p>There are 4 colored drums in the arena. All of them are on the mat. One of the drums, chosen at random, will be <strong>Blue</strong> in color. One of the Red drums, chosen at random, will contain an acoustic pinger which will emit a chirp. The AUV needs to drop a ball in one of the drums to successfully complete this task.</p>
<p>Points will be awarded as follows.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Drop the ball in the Blue drum. <strong>[30 Points]</strong></li>
<li>Drop the ball in the Red drum with the chirp pinger. <strong>[50 Points]</strong></li>
<li>Dropping the ball in any other Red drum. <strong>[10 Points]</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The target drum for the Acoustic mode may be randomized between attempts, similarly for the order of the drums.</p>
<h4 id="specification-of-props-"><a class="header-link" href="#specification-of-props-"></a>Specification of props.</h4>
<ul class="list">
<li>Drum: 60cm in diameter and 30cm in depth.</li>
<li>Ball : 3.5-4.5cm in diameter and weigh no more than 100g in air. Provided by teams.
In the event of multiple balls being dropped, only the first ball is taken to consideration.</li>
<li>Chirp Pinger : To Be Confirmed</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="target-reacquisition-60-points-"><a class="header-link" href="#target-reacquisition-60-points-"></a>Target Reacquisition <strong>[60 Points]</strong></h3>
<p>The aim of this task is to reacquire a previously detected target.</p>
<p>This task is only attemptable if the Target Acquisition has been successfully completed. Furthermore, the AUV has to leave the target zone, before it can attempt the Target Reacquisition task. Every part of the AUV needs to clear the target zone, before it can be considered outside the target zone.</p>
<p>After the AUV is outside the target zone, it needs to reacquire the target and pick up the ball that it dropped in the Target Acquisition task. The AUV has to hold on to the ball till the end of the attempt to successfully complete this task.</p>
<p>This task does not have to be attempted immediately after Target Acquisition task, other tasks may be attempted in between.</p>
<h4 id="specification-of-props--1"><a class="header-link" href="#specification-of-props--1"></a>Specification of props.</h4>
<ul class="list">
<li>Target zone : Green mat 8m x 2m in size.</li>
<li>Ball : Same ball used in target acquisition task. Provided by the teams.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="localization-40-points-"><a class="header-link" href="#localization-40-points-"></a>Localization <strong>[40 Points]</strong></h3>
<p>The aim of the this task is to localize on a flare. The flare is marked with an acoustic pinger. This flare could be located <strong>anywhere</strong> within the main arena. The AUV should locate and bump the flare causing the golf ball in the flare to drop out.</p>
<h4 id="specification-of-props--2"><a class="header-link" href="#specification-of-props--2"></a>Specification of props.</h4>
<ul class="list">
<li>Flare Pinger: RJE International Pinger Model No. ULB-362/37.5 kHz</li>
</ul>
<p class="img-container"><img src="img/flare.jpg" alt="flare"></p>
<div style="text-align:center"> Figure 3. Structure of the flare. </div>

<h3 id="surfacing"><a class="header-link" href="#surfacing"></a>Surfacing</h3>
<p>Breaching the surface any point during the mission causes the current attempt to come to an end. The team may wish to try again if they still have time left. When the AUV surfaces, and the current attempt comes to an end, the total points for that attempt will be computed based on the tasks accomplished and the timing bonus.</p>
<h3 id="timing-bonus"><a class="header-link" href="#timing-bonus"></a>Timing Bonus</h3>
<p>At the end of an attempt, as long as the AUV has successfully completed the Visual Navigation task, bonus points proportional to the remaining time will be awarded in accordance with the following formula.</p>
<p><code>Bonus points = (900 - RUN_TIME) • 0.03</code></p>
<p>For eg. For a run time of 420s, Bonus = (900-420)•0.03 = 14.4 Points</p>
<h3 id="penalties"><a class="header-link" href="#penalties"></a>Penalties</h3>
<p>There are penalty points for touching the floor or wall of the pool at any time, and also for touching the gate. This table states the penalties.</p>
