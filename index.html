<li> show clearly that someone pressing the <a href="#safety">Kill Switch</a> should stop all thrusters immediately.</li>
</ul>
<p>Videos will be reviewed by the organizing committee and <strong>30 teams with the best vehicles will be short-listed to attend the competition</strong>.</p>
<p>The organizers reserve the right to publish the video submissions after the competition.</p>
<h2 id="qualification"><a class="header-link" href="#qualification"></a>Qualification</h2>
<ul class="list">
<li>AUVs have to pass a qualifying round before they can participate in the main arena.</li>
<li>To qualify, an AUV has to swim from <strong>qualification starting line</strong> and pass through the <strong>qualification gate</strong> without surfacing, touching the bottom/wall or the qualification gate.</li>
<li>The time taken for the <strong>last part</strong> of the AUV to pass through the <strong>qualification gate</strong> will be counted towards the qualification time.</li>
<li>Teams will be allocated a time slot for the qualification round. Teams may attempt multiple qualifying runs during the qualifying slot.</li>
<li>If multiple qualifying runs are attempted during the qualifying slot, the fastest successful run will be considered for the final round.</li>
<li><strong>Only the top 15</strong> qualified teams, with the fastest time for the qualifying round, will advance to the final round.</li>
<li>The time taken to pass the qualifier round decides the sequence in which the teams will participate in the final round of the competition. The team that finished the last in the qualifying round would participate first in the final round.</li>

<h2 id="tasks"><a class="header-link" href="#tasks"></a>Tasks</h2>
<p>There are 4 tasks in the challenge:</p>
<ol class="list">
<li><a href="#1.-navigation">Navigation</a></li>
<li><a href="#2.-target-acquisition">Target Acquisition</a></li>
<li><a href="#3.-target-reacquisition">Target Reacquisition</a></li>
<li><a href="#4.-localization">Communication &amp; Localization</a></li>
</ol>
<p>The first task, Navigation, is mandatory and <strong>must be completed</strong> before attempting any other task. The other tasks can be attempted in any order. Surfacing at any point signifies <span class="emphasis">end of the attempt</span>.</p>
<h3 id="1-navigation"><a class="header-link" href="#1-navigation"></a>1. Navigation</h3>
<p>The aim of this task is to swim through a gate placed at the bottom of the pool. The gate may be located anywhere on a horizontal line, parallel to the side of the swimming pool, approximately 12m away from the starting zone. See Figure 4. The AUV has to swim through the 150 cm tall gate without touching the gate.</p>
<p><strong>A orange flare</strong> may be located anywhere in a rectangular zone 4m-8m from side of the arena, before the gate. The AUV <strong>has to avoid</strong> touching the orange flare. Any part of the AUV touching the orange flare causes an immediate <span class="important">abort</span> of the attempt.</p>

<h3 id="2-target-acquisition"><a class="header-link" href="#2-target-acquisition"></a>2. Target Acquisition</h3>
<p>The aim of the task is to detect and acquire a target among a series of drums at the bottom of the pool, in the target zone.</p>
<p>A target zone is defined by a <span class="indicate-green">green colored mat</span> laid out on the floor of the pool. The mat is 8m x 2m in size. Figure 4. shows the location of the mat with respect to the arena.</p>
<p>There are 4 colored drums in the arena. All of them are on the mat. One of the drums, chosen at random, will be <span class="indicate-blue">blue</span> in color, while the rest are <span class="indicate-red">red</span> in color. One of the <span class="indicate-red">red drums</span>, chosen at random, will contain an acoustic pinger. The AUV needs to drop a ball in one of the drums to successfully complete this task. Points will be awarded based on which drum the ball is dropped into. In the event of multiple balls being dropped, only the <strong>first ball</strong> is taken to consideration.</p>
<p>The location of the <span class="indicate-red">red drum</span> which contains the acoustic pinger may be randomized between attempts, as may be the order of the drums. The order of the drums and location of the pinger will be decided by the organizing committee.</p>
<h4 id="points-1"><a class="header-link" href="#points-1"></a>Points</h4>
<p>Points will be awarded as follows.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Drop the ball in the <span class="indicate-blue">blue drum</span>: <span class="info">30 Points</span></li>
<li>Drop the ball in the <span class="indicate-red">red drum</span> with the pinger: <span class="info">50 Points</span></li>

<p>The aim of this task is to reacquire a previously detected target.</p>
<p>This task is only attempt-able if the <a href="#2.-target-acquisition">Target Acquisition</a> has been successfully completed. Furthermore, the AUV has to leave the target zone, before it can attempt the Target Reacquisition task. Every part of the AUV needs to clear the target zone, before it can be considered outside the target zone.</p>
<p>After the AUV is outside the target zone, it needs to reacquire the target and pick up the ball that it dropped in the <a href="#2.-target-acquisition">Target Acquisition</a> task. The AUV has to hold on to the ball till the <span class="emphasis">end of attempt</span> to successfully complete this task.</p>
<p>This task does not have to be attempted immediately after Target Acquisition task, other tasks may be attempted in between.</p>
<h4 id="points-2"><a class="header-link" href="#points-2"></a>Points</h4>
<p>If the AUV successfully picks up the ball and holds on to it till the <span class="emphasis">end of the attempt</span>, <span class="info">60 Points</span> will be awarded.</p>

<h3 id="4-communication--localization"><a class="header-link" href="#4-communication--localization"></a>4. Communication &amp; Localization</h3>
<p>The aim of this task is to localize on coloured flares and bump them causing a golf ball to drop out. There are <strong>3 coloured flares</strong> in the arena, one <strong>red coloured flare</strong>, one <strong>yellow coloured flare</strong> and one <strong>blue coloured flare</strong>. These flares could be located <strong>anywhere</strong> within the main arena. The AUV may locate and bump a flares in <strong>a specified order</strong>, which may be communicated to the AUV, to receive bonus points.</p>
<p>On every attempt, after the AUV successfully completes the <em>Navigation task</em>, the team will be informed of the <strong>order</strong> in which the flares have to be bumped. The <strong>specified order</strong> may be different between different attempts. The order will specified using the following notation, joined by a hyphen (-).</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><span class="indicate-red">Red</span> : <strong>R</strong></li>
<li><span class="indicate-yellow">Yellow</span> : <strong>Y</strong></li>
<li><span class="indicate-blue">Blue</span> : <strong>B</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>So, for example, specifying the order as <strong>R-B-Y</strong> would mean that the AUV has to bump the <strong>red flare</strong> first, followed by the <strong>blue flare</strong> and finally the <strong>yellow flare</strong>.</p>
<p>The team is then allowed to communicate the <strong>order</strong> with their AUVs using their <a href="#specification-of-auv">communication equipment</a>.</p>
<h4 id="points-3"><a class="header-link" href="#points-3"></a>Points</h4>
<p>Points would be awarded as follows.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Successfully causes the ball to drop from any flare via contact or proximity : <span class="info">20 Points per flare</span></li>
<li>Successfully causes the ball to drop all 3 flares in the <strong>specified order</strong> : <span class="info">60 Points</span> (in addition to above)</li>

<h3 id="surfacing"><a class="header-link" href="#surfacing"></a>Surfacing</h3>
<p>Breaching the surface any point during the mission causes <span class="emphasis">end of the current attempt</span>, the total points for that attempt will be computed based on the tasks accomplished in that attempt and the timing bonus (if applicable) and a <span class="info">5 Points</span> bonus for ending. The team may wish to retry if they still have time left.</p>
<h3 id="aborting"><a class="header-link" href="#aborting"></a>Aborting</h3>
<p>At any time during the mission, current attempt can be <span class="important">aborted</span>, by indicating to the <span class="inverse">Game Master</span>. The divers would then retrieve the AUV back to the starting zone. The timing for the current attempt is stopped at the time of indication. The team may wish to retry if they still have time left.</p>
<p>In the case of an aborted attempt, the team would be awarded the points for all previously successfully completed tasks during the current attempt.</p>
<h3 id="automatic-abort"><a class="header-link" href="#automatic-abort"></a>Automatic Abort</h3>
<p>If the AUV touches the bottom or the side walls of the pool for <strong>a cumulative time of more than 10 seconds or 5 discrete touches</strong>, the current attempt would be automatically <span class="important">aborted</span>. The divers would then retrieve the AUV back to the starting zone. The team may wish to retry if they still have time left.</p>
<p>In the case of an automatic aborted attempt, the team would be awarded the points for all previously successfully completed tasks during the attempt.</p>
<h3 id="timing-bonus"><a class="header-link" href="#timing-bonus"></a>Timing Bonus</h3>
<p>At the <span class="emphasis">end of an attempt</span>, as long as the AUV has successfully completed at least <strong>2 tasks</strong>, the Navigation task and any other task, bonus points proportional to the remaining time will be awarded in accordance with the following formula.</p>
<p><code>Bonus points = (900 - RUN_TIME) â€¢ 0.03</code></p>
<p>For eg. For a run time of 420s, Bonus = (900-420)â€¢0.03 = 14.4 Points</p>
<h3 id="penalties"><a class="header-link" href="#penalties"></a>Penalties</h3>
<p>There are penalty points for touching the floor or wall of the pool at any time, and also for touching the gate during a specific attempt. This penalty points are:</p>

<h2 id="bonus-round-oceanic-navigation"><a class="header-link" href="#bonus-round-oceanic-navigation"></a>Bonus Round: Oceanic Navigation</h2>
<p>For SAUVC 2024, there is a bonus round with a single task called Oceanic Navigation. This was created to allow teams to experience the challenges of operating in an oceanic environment. The bonus round will be held in the <a href="https://www.tcoms.sg/">TCOMS Ocean Basin</a>, a cutting-edge facility for testing and developing marine technology. The basin is located at the <a href="https://www.nus.edu.sg/">National University of Singapore</a>.</p>
<p class="img-container"><img src="img/ocean-basin.jpg" alt="arena"></p>
<p class="image-caption"> Ocean basin at TCOMS. </p>

<p>The aim of this task is for the AUV to swim through a gate in the middle of the pool. At the ocean basin, the AUVs will have to deal with waves and currents. Only the top teams from the final round will be invited to the bonus round.</p>
<p><strong>An orange flare</strong> may be located anywhere in the ocean basin. The AUV <strong>has to avoid</strong> touching the orange flare. Any part of the AUV touching the orange flare causes an immediate <span class="important">abort</span> of the attempt.</p>
<h4 id="arena-ocean-basin"><a class="header-link" href="#arena-ocean-basin"></a>Arena (Ocean Basin)</h4>
<p>The basin is equipped with a wave generator capable of generating waves up to 0.5m in height and a current generator capable of generating currents up to 1.5m/s. The wave and current generators may be activated during the bonus round.</p>
<p class="img-container"><img src="img/arena-ocean-basin.jpg" alt="arena"></p>
<p class="image-caption"> Top view of the ocean basin arena. </p>

<p><strong>This layout is for illustration purposes only; Deployment and retrieval location may be subject to changes.</strong></p>
<p>Since the basin is a research facility, and the area is not typically open to the public, only a small predetermined number of the participants and viewers will be allowed into the facility to watch the attempt from the viewing gallery.</p>
<p>Members of the team doing the attempt will have to operate at the AUV Deployment/Retrieval corner under the supervision of SAUVC committee members.</p>
<p>Judges and TCOMS staff will be located in the subcarriage in the facility which will be positioned above the gate, providing a direct view of the gate. After a successful round/abort, the AUV will be retrieved by divers.</p>
<p>Details on the number of participants allowed to enter the viewing gallery will be released at a later date.</p>
<h4 id="starting-zone-1"><a class="header-link" href="#starting-zone-1"></a>Starting Zone</h4>
<p>The starting zone is a <strong>140Ã—140cm area</strong> marked on the surface of the water. The teams <strong>must</strong> start their AUVs from this area. The team may only place the AUV at the water surface, it must autonomously submerge <strong>before</strong> leaving the starting zone.</p>
<h4 id="surfacing-1"><a class="header-link" href="#surfacing-1"></a>Surfacing</h4>
<p>Breaching the surface at any point during the mission causes <span class="emphasis">end of the current attempt</span>. The team may wish to retry if they still have time left.</p>
<h4 id="deployment"><a class="header-link" href="#deployment"></a>Deployment</h4>
<p>Due to the logistics involved in deploying the AUV, teams are not allowed to manually deploy the AUV. The AUV will be deployed to the starting zone by Ocean Basin staff. The team <strong>must</strong> provision a <strong>delayed start function</strong> for the AUV to start its thrusters <strong>120 seconds</strong> after they have passed it to the Ocean Basin staff. That way the Ocean Basin staff have enough time to move the AUV to the starting zone and leave the area before the AUV starts its mission. The start time for the first attempt will be measured from the time the AUV starts thrusting in the starting zone.</p>
<h4 id="points-4"><a class="header-link" href="#points-4"></a>Points</h4>
<p>There will be no points awarded for the bonus round. The teams will be ranked based on the time taken to the <span class="emphasis">end of the attempt</span> ONLY IF the team successfully managed to complete the task. The team with the fastest time will be ranked first in the bonus round.</p>
<h4 id="specification-of-props-5"><a class="header-link" href="#specification-of-props-5"></a>Specification of props</h4>
<p>The gate is located in the middle of the basin, ~25m from the starting zone. The gate is 200cm tall and 200cm wide. The gate is marked with <span class="indicate-red">red</span> and <span class="indicate-green">green</span> markings on the port and starboard sides respectively.</p>

<p>Only the top teams from the final round will be allowed to attempt the bonus round. Ranking for the bonus round will be tabulated separately from the main competition. The top teams in the bonus round will receive a special bonus prize regardless of their performance in the main competition.</p>
<p>There will be NO practice time for the bonus round. The teams will be given 30 minutes to attempt the bonus round. The teams may attempt the bonus round as many times as they wish within the 30-minute time slot. The team may choose to abort the attempt at any time. However, the retrieval of the AUV might take some time because of the logistics involved.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>All the <a href="#safety">safety</a> conditions and <a href="#game-procedure">game procedures</a> including <a href="#aborting">aborting</a> still apply during the bonus round.</li>
<li><strong>No communication</strong> with the AUV is allowed during the bonus round.</li>
<li>The teams are <strong>not allowed to deploy any other equipment</strong> into the basin.</li>
<li>Due to the sensitive nature of the equipment in the basin, the AUVs <strong>must not touch the walls or the floor of the basin</strong>. Any part of the AUV touching the walls of the basin causes an immediate <span class="important">abort</span> of the attempt.</li>
